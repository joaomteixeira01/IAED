# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ Vaccine Management System

## Final Grade: 17/20

This project consists of implementing a system in C for managing vaccines and inoculations for users, as part of the course *Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures (IAED)*.

The interaction with the program is done through textual input, using commands that allow:

- Registration of new vaccine batches with expiration dates and number of doses  
- Application of doses to users with validity and availability checks  
- Listing vaccines and inoculations in chronological order  
- Removal of vaccines and deletion of inoculation records  
- Simulation of time advancement in the system  
- Support for error messages in Portuguese using the `pt` argument
